 * - update an item in the db, given the id
 * - list a summary of all items in the db
 * - get details about a single item, given the id
 * - delete an item in the database, given the id

 * >>you must use the static functionality to serve up an html file that acts as the documentation for your api
 * >>your code/functions must have good code comments / documentation
 * >>your application must connect to a database (mysql)
 * >>you must use dotenv to store sensitive information (db password, username, url)
